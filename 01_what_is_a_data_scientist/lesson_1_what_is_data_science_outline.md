# What is Data Science

* Ask the class

# Goals
Regression, Classification, Pattern Detection

# Data mining, data analysis, data science, statistics, predictive analytics

# History

# Why now
January 2009 Hal Varian, Google’s Chief Economist, tells the McKinsey Quarterly: The ability to take data—to be able to understand it, to process it, to extract value from it, to visualize it, to communicate it—that’s going to be a hugely important skill in the next decades…

# Case studies,

# Features

# Flow

Raw data => data munging => feature engineering => models => visualization

# Supervised vs Unsupervised

# Other applications

* dimension reduction

# Where's the data?

database, online, 3rd party applications (Saleforce, Marketo)

# What about Big Data?

# NLP

# Predictive analytics

# Time series

# No free lunch

# Dimensionnality curse

# Over fitting vs Under fitting

# Deep learning ? is classic DS still relevant?

# Why
salary, sexy, ... but also lots of excitement with discoveries

2001 Leo Breiman publishes “Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures” (PDF): “There are two cultures in the use of statistical modeling to reach conclusions from data. One assumes that the data are generated by a given stochastic data model. The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.”
