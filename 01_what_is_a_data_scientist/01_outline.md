# THE DATA SCIENCE WORKFLOW
 6 steps
=> Problem identification
=> Get Raw Data
=> Data munging (missing values, imbalanced sets, normalization,)
=> Feature engineering (vectorization, )
=> Models (cross validation, test, grid search, optimization)
=> Visualization (matplotlib, dashboards, tableau, plotly, bokeh, )

# Step 1: What's the problem

* Business objectives,
* Success metrics,
* Find the right datasets

# Step 2: Acquire the data

* Availability
* Copies of Production?
* Relevant?
* Heterogeneous Sources: databases, files (csv, pdf),

# Step 3: Exploratory analysis and Data munging

* Documentation
* Exploratory Data Visualization and Stats (histograms, means, ...)
* Distribution
* Trends, outliers

Assess its relevance

* Time constraints: when is the data produced, too old?
* Formats (dates, amounts, Imperial vs )

Data Munging

* Missing values, imbalanced sets, normalization

# Step 4: Feature engineering

* Create new variables from existing ones. Large subject
* For instance: polynomial, combining, ...

# Step 5: Build a model

* What's a model? (Q to the class)

* Select the Right type of models for the task: Regression, Classification, detection, outlier detection, ...
* Scikit learn decision graph

* Select the metric: precision, recall, accuracy, ...., RMSE, ranking
* Try different models, see how they perform,
* Fine tune their parameters

# Step 6: The results

* Scores
* Data visualization: plots, dashboards
* Integration, production

# Futurama Example
Applications on data: prediction, grouping, ...

# Guided Practice: work in groups
