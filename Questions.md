# Questions

* I use Jekyll / Reveal.js for my slides. It's css based. Do you have css style sheets for slides?
* Is there a slack channel for instructor (DS or non DS) where I can ask questions (right now finding the style sheets for the slides)
* python3 is now at 3.5, worried that using 2.7 is going to be painful

Lesson 1:

* The 1st quizz asks questions that the students cannot answer yet and introduces concpets that we'll see later in the course ...
for instance: Linear regression is an unsupervised learning algorithm.
How to deal with that?

* The group activity ... not really data science ... more team building, getting to know each other
I'd change that to groups of 4, helping each other with python setup, git ...
Share knowledge, help each other, talk about results
